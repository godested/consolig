# Consolig

Consolig is a version of Consolas that supports ligatures. Unlike other efforts, all ligatures in Consolig were made by hand from the original Consolas glyphs (they are not just copied from another ligature font).

Because Consolas cannot be redistributed, this project provides the tools to append the ligature glyphs and features to your personal copy of Consolas, generating a copy of Consolig.

Glyph substitution and font build logic was taken from [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code).
