# Consolig

Consolig is a version of Consolas that supports ligatures. All ligatures were made by hand from the original Consolas glyphs (they are not just a copy from Fira Code).

Because Consolas cannot be redistributed, this project provides the tools to append the ligature glyphs and features to your personal copy of Consolas, generating a copy of Consolig.

Glyph substitution logic was taken directly from [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).
