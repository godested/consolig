# Consolig

Consolig is a version of Consolas that supports ligatures. Unlike other similar efforts, all ligatures in Consolig were made by hand from the original Consolas glyphs (they are not just copied from Fira Code).

Because Consolas cannot be redistributed, this project provides the tools to append the ligature glyphs and features to your personal copy of Consolas, generating a copy of Consolig.

Glyph substitution logic was taken directly from [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).
